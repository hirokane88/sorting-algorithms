# Sorting

### Description

This is c program designed to implement four sorting algorithms. The algorithms are bubble sort, shell sort, quicksort, and heap sort. The algorithms are contained in the bubble.c, shell.c, quick.c, and heap.c files respectively. The API for the program is contained in the sorting.c file along with it's subsequent command options.

### Build

The c code to compiled is contained in the sorting.c file. Use a c compiler to compile the code in the file.

### Run
	
After compiling the sorting.c file, run the subsequent binary. To do this enter './sorting' into the command line. The program will will then print the 4 sorting algorithms with their default values and formats.
